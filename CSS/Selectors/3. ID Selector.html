    <h3>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. <br> <br>

        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element! <br> <br>

        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
    </h3>
